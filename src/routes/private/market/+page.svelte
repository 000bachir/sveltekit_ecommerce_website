            ðŸ§  Design & Architecture Decisions: <br> This project isn't just a demo â€” it's a case study in
            building a modern e-commerce interface using SvelteKit and Supabase, while simulating the kind
            of structure seen in large-scale applications. Below are the key decisions and the thinking
            behind them:<br> 1. Two Navbars for Contextual UX I implemented two separate navigation bars to
            reflect how larger platforms often split concerns between global (auth, cart) and local
            (category browsing) navigation. This approach also subtly indicates the userâ€™s authentication
            state without relying on user avatars or complex profile systems. Personally, I find this method
            cleaner and more secure-looking â€” especially when users forget to log out â€” because the UI
            changes visually based on login state.<br> 2. Lightweight Cart with Local Storage The cart behaves
            like a quick-access version similar to what Amazon offers. Instead of syncing with a backend, I
            store cart items in the browser using localStorage. This shows how to manage state in a
            performant way without relying on a database for everything â€” useful for small apps or MVPs.<br> 3.
            Supabase: Using the Free Tier Effectively This app uses Supabase's free tier to demonstrate how
            much you can build without scaling costs. It includes: Email/password user authentication OAuth
            (GitHub integration) Basic security rules This setup is ideal for indie hackers or early-stage
            prototypes.<br> 4. Fast Loading with SvelteKit Preload Product data is fetched from the Dummy JSON
            API and displayed using SvelteKitâ€™s load function. Even though the data is relatively small, it
            includes metadata and images â€” enough to demonstrate how fast and efficient SvelteKit can be
            with data fetching, SSR, and reactivity.
